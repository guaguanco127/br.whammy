## <a name="About"></a>About

This is a spectral Max/MSP abstraction and Ableton Max for Live device that allows the user to transpose the pitch of a stereo signal up to two octaves and down to two octaves. Suitable for harmonization and microtonal pitch-shifting. Currently works in any sample rate or bit depth.

This effect introduces no latency. However, some artifacts are included to the signal. For an artifact-free version of a whammy (that introduces some latency) use [br.pitchshift](https://github.com/guaguanco127/br.pitchshift) instead.  

It currently only works as an abstraction or a device. External objects and RNBO not available yet. 

**On/Off:** Turn the effect on or bypass
  
**Pitchshift:** Pitchshift Factor in steps. -24. to 24. Default 0. Microtonal pitchshifting is possible by using numbers in between integers. For example, -0.50 is pitchshifted down by a quarter tone.   

**Dry/Wet:** The amount of dry and wet signal between 0. and 100. The default is 100. The wet signal is latent by 2048 samples. 



## <a name="M4L"></a>What Is a Max For Live Device?

Max For Live brings the power and flexibility of Max to Ableton Live. Max For Live gives you access to hundreds of exclusive custom plug-ins (Live Devices) as well as the tools to build your own. These can be MIDI and audio effects, audio and video synthesizers, 3D Jitter visuals, as well as tools that interact with the Live application itself, via the Live API.
