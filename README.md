## <a name="About"></a>About

This is a spectral Max/MSP abstraction and Ableton Max for Live device that allows the user to transpose the pitch of a stereo signal up to two octaves and down to two octaves. Suitable for harmonization and microtonal pitch-shifting. Currently works in any sample rate or bit depth.

This effect introduces no latency. However, some artifacts are included to the signal. For an artifact-free version of a whammy (that introduces some latency) use [br.pitchshift](https://github.com/guaguanco127/br.pitchshift) instead.  

It currently only works as an abstraction or a device. External objects and RNBO not available yet. 

**On/Off:** Turn the effect on or bypass
  
**Pitchshift:** Pitchshift Factor in steps. -24. to 24. Default 0. Microtonal pitchshifting is possible by using numbers in between integers. For example, -0.50 is pitchshifted down by a quarter tone.   

**Dry/Wet:** The amount of dry and wet signal between 0. and 100. The default is 100. The wet signal is latent by 2048 samples.
